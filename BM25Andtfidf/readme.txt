Quick Start
We start by setting up the directory in case using pycharm IDE
Or
The file path in all .py files needs to be updated

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # filepath: need to be change 
    filepath = " {Updated file path}"

Every python file has their own the main function, which can run a python file to generate three result files which has been named by the
student name where it locate in the result folder. Alternatively, the python notebook has been create for testing the code.
